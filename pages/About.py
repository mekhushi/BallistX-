            This project blends classical physics with machine learning to simulate and predict the trajectory of a projectile (like a bullet, missile, or object under gravity + drag + wind effects). It visualizes both the physics-based simulation and ML predictions side by side""")

### 🧠 What Problem Does This Solve?

Traditional projectile simulators rely solely on physics equations, which can become inefficient or less flexible in real-time applications, especially when dealing with varying environmental factors like wind, mass, and angle.  
**Smart Ballistics Simulator** addresses this by blending classical **physics** with **machine learning (ML)**, allowing for:

- ⚡ Real-time prediction of projectile motion  
- 🔁 Continuous learning from new data  
- 🌬️ Adaptability to environmental changes (like wind speed)  
- 🎯 Improved targeting precision in ballistics simulations
