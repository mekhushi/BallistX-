### What is this project about?

This project simulates projectile trajectories using classical physics (with air drag and wind), 
and predicts trajectories instantly using a trained Machine Learning model.

- Explore how physics and AI combine to solve complex problems.
- Visualize real-time trajectory paths.
- Understand the effect of parameters like velocity, angle, mass, and wind.
