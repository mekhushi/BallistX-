# 🚀 BallistiX: Smart Ballistics Simulator
![](assets/main.jpg)

**BallistiX** is an AI-enhanced ballistics simulator that fuses physics-based modeling with machine learning to predict projectile trajectories with precision and speed.

Built using **PyTorch**, **Streamlit**, and scientific libraries like **NumPy** and **Matplotlib**, it allows users to visualize and compare traditional physics-based trajectories vs. neural network predictions—live, interactive, and with parameter control.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Predicting projectile trajectories in real-world conditions is **computationally intensive** due to non-linear factors like air resistance, wind, and mass variability.


- Traditional simulations solve complex differential equations in real-time.
- They're accurate but slow — especially at scale (defense sims, games, robotics).
- Neural networks can **learn these dynamics** and offer **faster, near-instant predictions**.

 **BallistiX solves this by combining physics and ML**, offering the best of both worlds:
- Verified physical accuracy from traditional methods.
- Fast, real-time inference from a trained ML model.

## 🔍 Use Cases

- 🛡️ **Defense & Military**: Simulate and predict projectile motion with various payloads, weather conditions, and launch angles.
- 🎮 **Game Development**: Integrate fast and realistic bullet or object motion into physics-based games.
- 🛰️ **Aerospace & Robotics**: Train drones or launch systems to adapt to wind, payload, or terrain dynamically.
- 📚 **Education**: Visual, interactive tool to teach students projectile motion, neural networks, and real-world physics constraints.
- 🧪 **Research**: Compare physics-based and learned models to study generalization in applied ML.

## 📈 Simulation Logic

### Physics-Based
Simulates trajectory using Newtonian equations with air drag and wind:
- Drag = `0.5 * rho * Cd * A * v²`
- Realistic wind resistance, acceleration due to gravity

### ML-Based
A Feedforward Neural Network learns to map:


Model trained on synthetic data generated by the physics engine.
